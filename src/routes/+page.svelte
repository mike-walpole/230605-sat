		<p class="mb-2">
			The European Network on Teaching Excellence (E-NOTE) seeks to map out key practices and
			attitudes that promote excellence at higher education institutions across the European Union.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-2">
			To this end we have developed three 10-minute surveys, focusing on teaching, management, and
			doctoral supervision, each aiming to gather individual experiences, draw collective patterns,
			and expand our understanding on how to better nurture and stimulate teaching excellence at
			European level.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-2">
			You can find more information about the activities and outputs of our project at
			www.teachingexcellence.eu or you can send us an email at info@teachingexcellence.eu
